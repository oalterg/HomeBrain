# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Project Is

HomeBrain is a self-hosted private cloud server automation platform. It automates deployment of Nextcloud and Home Assistant in Docker containers, accessible via encrypted tunnels (Pangolin or Cloudflare). There is no vendor lock-in; all data stays on-device. User manages all functionality via the dashboard GUI.

Two product variants share one codebase:
- **HomeCloud** — Raspberry Pi 5 (aarch64, 8 GB RAM). AI is opt-in. Headless appliance.
- **HomeBrain** — x86 mATX (AMD Ryzen CPU, RX 9060 XT GPU, Ubuntu Server). AI is opt-out (default-on). Runs llama-server with Vulkan GPU offload.

Platform is detected at runtime (`uname -m`) and drives all downstream behavior: package lists, AI build strategy, dashboard branding, and feature guards.

## Running the Application

The Flask manager runs on port 8000 via Gunicorn, managed by a systemd service:

```bash
# Production (systemd)
sudo systemctl start homebrain-manager

# Direct dev run (from repo root, with venv active)
source /opt/homebrain/venv/bin/activate
gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 src.app:app
```

There are no build steps, no transpilation, no Makefile.

## Architecture

### Process Model

Long-running operations (setup, backup, restore, upgrades) are launched as background subprocesses from Flask routes. Progress is tracked via a JSON status file in `/tmp` with in-memory fallback. The frontend polls `/api/task_status` to display progress.

### Flask App (`src/app.py`)

Single large Flask file (~1750 lines) containing all API routes, authentication, and system management logic. Key architectural patterns:

- **Session auth** with rate limiting (Flask-Limiter): 2000 req/min general, 5/min on `/login`
- **Subprocess spawning** (never `shell=True`) for Bash script execution
- **Atomic file writes** (mkstemp + rename) and `fcntl` locking for concurrent safety
- **One-time credential handover**: setup credentials written to a staging file, read once via `/api/setup/credentials`, then deleted

### Docker Compose Profiles

Services are activated by profile:
- (default/no profile) — `db`, `redis`, `nextcloud`, `homeassistant`
- `pangolin` — Newt tunnel container
- `cloudflare-nc`, `cloudflare-ha` — Cloudflare tunnel containers

### Bash Scripts (`scripts/`)

- `provision.sh` — One-time device setup: installs Docker, Python venv, pulls images, writes factory config to `/boot/firmware/factory_config.txt`
- `deploy.sh` — Starts/reconfigures the Docker stack
- `common.sh` — Shared utilities (health checks, env loading, Docker helpers) sourced by other scripts
- `backup.sh` / `restore.sh` — Data persistence for Nextcloud and Home Assistant
- `update.sh` — Self-update logic for the Manager app
- `utilities.sh` — System operations: Home Assistant admin account creation, Nextcloud cron, FTP, Zigbee

### Configuration

Environment variables live in `/opt/homebrain/.env` (generated from `config/.env.template`). Factory provisioning parameters are stored in `/boot/firmware/factory_config.txt`. Logs go to `/var/log/homebrain/`.

## Security Constraints

- Never use `shell=True` in subprocess calls — always pass commands as lists
- File writes to sensitive paths must use atomic pattern (mkstemp → rename) with `chmod 0o600`
- Login endpoint must remain rate-limited
- Session cookies must remain HTTPONLY + SAMESITE=Lax

## Migrations (`src/migration.py`)

Runs on app startup to handle version drift (e.g., syncing the systemd service file from the repo, renaming legacy cron jobs). Add new migrations here when deployments need one-time fixups.

## Contributing

### Branching & PRs
- Never commit directly to `main` — create a feature branch and merge via pull request
- Branch names should be descriptive: `feature/openclaw-integration`, `fix/backup-timeout`
- PRs require review before merge; keep them focused on a single concern

### Commit Style
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- Subject line under 72 characters, imperative mood ("add X" not "added X")
- Body explains *why*, not *what* (the diff shows what)

### Testing
- Test on the target Raspberry Pi 5 before signing off work — the dev machine is not the deployment environment
- Verify dashboard interactions end-to-end (button click → background task → status update)
- For bash scripts: test both fresh-install and re-run (idempotency) paths

### General
- Aim for robustness and user-friendliness — the user should never need to SSH
- Ask when uncertain rather than guessing
- Think critically and give open feedback on the approach, not just the implementation
